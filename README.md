Heating engineer
Hi. Im a heating engineer in the uk. Keen on energy efficiency. passionate to be fair. Anyway 80% of condensing boilers in the uk dont condense..fact...have the ability to but dont. Tosh written by manu saying they can but the math dont support it. Looking everywhere to see if i can join pieces together to influence the today and tomorrow in control . Needs to be simople so opentherm might be one ave.
